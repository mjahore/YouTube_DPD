# Let's Write a DPD Simulation in C: A YouTube Miniseries

This code is the result of a series of YouTube videos aimed at briefly introducing the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation framework, and guiding the viewer through the simple process of writing a fairly efficient simulation from scratch. Although there are several great applications out there that can do DPD simulations (e.g., LAMMPS, HOOMD-blue, Materials Studio, and others), it can be very instructive to write one's own simulation. My mantra is that if I can't write it myself, I don't truly understand what is going on under the hood -- and I don't like to trust black boxes in science! For those who are interested, my research group maintains its own DPD code written in Fortran 77 that supports parallel/distributed computing using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). PD<sup>2</sup> is available at https://www.github.com/mjahore/PD2.

The YouTube miniseries can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/xxxxxxx.

This source is laid out to mirror the progress that is made in each video. The final, full code is contained in the Final_Code/ subdirectory of this repository. I've made every attempt to make the code as readable as possible with ample comments.
