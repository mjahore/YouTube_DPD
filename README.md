# Let's Write a DPD Simulation in C: A YouTube Miniseries

This code is the result of a series of YouTube videos aimed at briefly introducing the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation framework, and guiding the viewer through the simple process of writing a fairly efficient simulation from scratch. Although there are several great applications out there that can do DPD simulations (e.g., LAAMPS, Materials Studio, and others), it can be very instructive to write one's own simulation. My mantra is that if I can't write it myself, I don't truly understand what is going on under the hood -- and I don't like to trust black boxes in science!

The YouTube miniseries can be viewed at: http://www.youtube.com/xxxxxxx.
